# Data Science and Analytics Portfolio

This GitHub repository contains some data projects that I have worked on. The purpose of this repository is to showcase the skills and techniques I learn along the way as I go forward with my career in the professional data field.

## [Predicting Successful Loan Payments Using Several Machine Learning Models](https://github.com/youngnguyen1/IBM-Data-Science-Capstone)

September 2022

This project was part of the IBM Data Science Certificate program. I learned of many different machine learning models during this program, and was able to put several classification models to the test in this project. I was able to come up with predictions on whether or not a person would be able to pay off their loans based on historical loan information. I have included my data science methodology as well as the final result of the predictions to showcase my work in exploratory data analysis, visualizations, and predictive modeling.

Models used:

* K Nearest Neighbors
* Decision Trees
* Support Vector Machine
* Logistic Regression

## [Web scraping GitHub Repositories](https://github.com/youngnguyen1/web-scraping-github)

August 2022

This project uses the Python BeautifulSoup Library to scrape the contents of GitHub pages. I extracted key information from popular repositories from the GitHub Topics page using the html content of the page. The code also writes that information into different csv files for each repository.

## [Sentiment Analysis on Yelp Reviews](https://github.com/youngnguyen1/yelp-sentiment-analysis)


July 2022

This project takes a labeled dataset of Yelp reviews, splits it into test and trainging sets using Scikit Learn, and fits it to a Naive Bayes Algorithm. We can check the accuracy of the model as well as calculate the probability of a prediction being correct. This project can easily be scaled to fit similar review platforms such as IMDB or Google reviews.
